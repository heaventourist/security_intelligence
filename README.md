# security_intelligence
This webpage is built to help visualize a security intelligence data feed from [National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/data-feeds). The front-end of this webpage is written in [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/index.html), with UI components patched in from [iView](https://www.iviewui.com/). The backend is written in Python, using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) as framework. The back-end data is stored in [sqlite3](https://docs.python.org/2/library/sqlite3.html), a builtin module available in Python.
